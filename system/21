# List all real users on the VM

# https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-list-users-in-linux/

# There is no real technical difference between the system and regular (normal) users. 
# Typically system users are created when installing the OS and new packages. 
# In some cases you can create a system user that will be used by some application.

# Normal users are the users created by the root or other user with sudo privileges. 
# Usually a normal user has a real login shell and a home directory.

# Each user has a numeric user ID called UID. 
# If not specified when creating a new user with the useradd command, 
# the UID will be automatically selected from the /etc/login.defs file 
# depending on the UID_MIN and UID_MIN values.

# To check the UID_MIN and UID_MIN values on your system you can use the following command:

grep -E '^UID_MIN|^UID_MAX' /etc/login.defs

# The command bellow will list all normal users in our linux system:

getent passwd {1000..60000}
