# In what file can you find the installed version of your Debian?

# The easiest way on how to check what Debian version you are running is to simply read a content of /etc/issue file. Example:

cat /etc/issue

# However, the above command may not show the current Debian update point releases. Thus you may get more accurate info with the following linux command:

cat /etc/debian_version
