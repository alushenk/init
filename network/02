# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_address
# The broadcast address for an IPv4 host can be obtained by 
# performing a bitwise OR operation between the bit complement 
# of the subnet mask and the host's IP address.
# (IP or not MASK actually) 

printf "my ip address: "
ipconfig getifaddr en0
# or 
# networksetup -getinfo Ethernet | sed -n 2p | awk '{print $3}'
# or
# networksetup -getinfo Ethernet | awk 'NR==2{print $3}'

BROADCAST=$(ifconfig en0 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $6}')
echo "broadcast: $BROADCAST"

# refresh arp table (network statistic or something). 
# just ping broadcast for 1 second then stops
# ping $BROADCAST & sleep 1; kill $!
# on linux it can be like
# timeout 1s ping $BROADCAST
# but I'm a hacker
ping -t 1 $BROADCAST > /dev/null
