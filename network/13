# Thanks previously answer and DNS sever find your hostname

# we can find hotname simply by typing:

hostname

# or ask default DNS server (/etc/resolv.conf -> 10.51.1.253) for our ip 
# we may not pass DNS argument to nslokup because its used by default

DNS=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf |grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}')
IP=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0)

nslookup $IP $DNS | grep name |awk '{print $4}'
